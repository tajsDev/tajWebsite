# Exciting News: Funding Secured for Cleanser!

I am thrilled to announce that my honors capstone project, *Cleanser*, has received funding! This support enables us to enhance both the artistic and research dimensions of the project, culminating in a game showcase later this December.

## Overview of the Game
*Cleanser* is an immersive game set in a fantasy world where players face the challenge of determining whether to spare their enemies. Players must save their village from corruption, battling against their own corrupted friends and neighbors. The ultimate goal is to defeat a final boss and cleanse the corrupted characters, transforming them into allies. Players are given the choice to either redeem or eliminate their enemies, allowing us to explore the motivations behind their decisions.

## Purpose of the Funding
I have qualified for a stipend from the Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation, an organization dedicated to diversifying STEM fields. My strong GPA and active involvement with the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers contributed to my eligibility. As part of this funding, I am required to present at the Festival of Engineering and Science later this year.

## Allocation of Funds
The majority of the funding will be allocated to expanding *Cleanser* into a comprehensive research study. I will be working with an assistant and my mentor to complete necessary research documentation and sessions later this year. Additionally, a portion of the funding will enhance the game's artwork.
## Research Focus
Our research will primarily investigate two factors: the removal of a protective barrier around enemies and variations in their artistic representation. For the control group, enemies will appear more monster-like, while another group will feature more humanoid designs. In the initial levels, enemies will be shielded, preventing players from eliminating them and encouraging them to save them instead. As the game progresses, this protective barrier will be removed to assess whether players will instinctively choose to save or attack the enemies. By removing the barrier entirely, we aim to understand if players will prioritize saving enemies based on their own volition. 
Thank you for your support, and I look forward to sharing more about this exciting journey!
