# Welcome to my website !
This website was created with the intention of streamlining content
and make it easier to add more information.  
## The Problem
This is how my previous website looked:

![alt text](image url "image Title")

It was a static html template where I had to edit content by directly 
changing the HTML template. I did not like this and abandon it after 
2 months. It was too much work to add more info. So I need a better way
to create content on my website.
## The Solution
I have thought of three things for my website that I needed: 
1.Using some file format of writing articles and updates
2.Having all of stored in a format is easy and understandable
3.Have all of the parts of the website split up so I can edit different parts easier

This lead me to use react and Next JS, so tech that I have wanted to try for a while
React allow be to seperate all of the pieces of my website and import the data
using javascript arrays.

For the articles I decided to use markdown since react had a package for it and 
to me at least, easier to edit than html.
