    make moral decisions about whether to save or eliminate enemies. The 
    primary objective is to explore the factors that encourage non-violent 
    tactics. The game features a unique cleansing mechanic that allows 
    players to transform enemies into allies. This project has been awarded 
    a grant to facilitate an in-depth research study aimed at understanding 
    these factors.`,

    learn how to walk with an exoskeleton. The game that we made was a 2D side
    scroller with the steps from the user as the input. I created the game 
    loop, player, enemies, and user interface for the game. The game was present
    at 2 capstone conferences and received praised for the gameplay and overall
    goal of the project.`,

    allows for parts such as health, damage, and reaction to be implemented  
    easily for all of the enemies. The game was created with 3 other people

    designed for office people. I had implemented 9 out of 12 levels and 
    structured the entire game state system. The every 3 levels had a theme, 
    I worked on 2 of those themes. I created levels with the idea of easy but 
    more strokes, or a harder challenge for fewer putts. This game was built with 4
    other people and was presented in my software engineering class at the end
    of the semester.`,
